# Session Log — Castleton Dental Website Build

---

## Session 1 — 24 March 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Context
First Claude Code session on the Castleton Dental website build. Working from the skeleton HTML committed to GitHub and the CAS001_Website build folder on Desktop.

### Files Reviewed
- All HTML pages in `/` and `/treatments/` (GitHub repo)
- `styles.css`
- `Phase 5 - Content & Brand/Castleton Content Mapping.docx` — full content status map
- `Phase 3 - Digital Asset Audit/Fee Guide 2026.pdf` — official fee schedule Jan 2026
- `Phase 2 - Scoping Call/Castleton_Meeting_Minutes.docx` — agreed brief and decisions
- `Phase 2 - Scoping Call/logos and leaflets for new patients/` — logo and building assets

### Work Completed

#### 1. `prices.html` — Full fee guide populated
Replaced all `TBC` placeholder content with real fees from the official **Fee Guide Jan 2026** PDF.

Sections added:
- **General & Preventative** — examinations (new patient, regular, children by age band), emergency, radiograph, hygienist, missed appointment policy
- **Restorative** — amalgam and composite fillings, root canal (incisor/premolar/molar), acrylic and metal dentures
- **Cosmetic Dentistry** — cosmetic fillings, tooth whitening, crowns, veneers, Invisalign (single and double arch)
- **Implants & Oral Surgery** — implant placement, PRF, implant crown
- **Other** — sports mouthguards (coloured and patterned)

All sections now include a **CDM Member** column showing included items and 10% discounts where applicable.

Footnote added: *"All fees are intended as a guide only. A written treatment estimate will be provided prior to commencing treatment. Fees correct as of January 2026."*

CDM membership section updated with descriptive copy and dual CTA (Ask About Membership / Book an Appointment).

#### 2. Digital assets copied to repo
Created `images/` directory and copied the following as placeholders (logo in development):
- `images/castleton-logo.png`
- `images/castleton-logo.jpg`
- `images/castleton-house.jpg`

## Session 2 — 24 March 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Context
Follow-on session. Focus on improving the contact page map embed.

### Work Completed

#### 1. `contact.html` — Google Maps iframe with correct pin

**Problem:** The original `<iframe>` embed used a placeholder URL with no valid place ID (`!1s0x0%3A0x0`), so no pin was ever rendered on load.

**Solution:** Google Maps iframe using a business name + address query URL. Google resolves this to its own verified listing and drops the standard red pin automatically. No API key required.

```
https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Castleton+Dental+Practice,+11+Castle+Street,+Farnham,+GU9+7JA&z=16&output=embed
```

**Note on custom logo pin:** Deferred — requires Google Maps JavaScript API key. Guide in Appendix.

**Files changed:** `contact.html`, `styles.css`

**Commit:** `Revert to Google Maps iframe — remove Leaflet/OpenStreetMap implementation`

> ⚠️ **Push required** — commits staged locally. Push via GitHub Desktop.

---

## Session 3 — 25 March 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Context
Planning session via Claude (claude.ai). Focus on colour palette refinement, referral form upgrade, and style guide versioning. No Claude Code used — changes packaged for manual push via GitHub Desktop.

### Work Completed

#### 1. `styles.css` — Palette updated to v3.0

**v2.0 (from Holly's palette image):** Mint-based palette replaced with warm olive and linen tones.

| Variable | v1.0 | v2.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-primary` | `#7ccba6` Arsenic | `#8A8E75` Olive |
| `--color-primary-dark` | `#31694c` Deep Forest | `#68604D` Dark Olive |
| `--color-primary-mid` | `#77b197` Sage | `#BEC5A4` Sage Soft |
| `--color-primary-light` | `#a3d2bd` Soft Mint | `#D5C7AD` Sand |
| `--color-bg` | `#ebfaf4` Off-White Mint | `#F1EAD8` Linen |
| `--color-brass` | `#B5935A` | `#B5935A` ✓ Confirmed |

**v3.0 (Sage Soft and Dark Olive swapped):** Sage Soft (`#BEC5A4`) now governs navigation, CTAs, and active states.

| Variable | v2.0 | v3.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-primary-dark` | `#68604D` Dark Olive | `#BEC5A4` Sage Soft |
| `--color-primary-mid` | `#BEC5A4` Sage Soft | `#68604D` Dark Olive |

**Files changed:** `styles.css`

#### 2. `referrals.html` — Full referral form rebuild

Three-section layout matching toothbeary.co.uk/referrals structure:
- **Section 1 — Referring Practice:** Name, dentist, email, phone, address
- **Section 2 — Patient Details:** Name, DOB, phone, email, treatment type dropdown, clinical notes, urgency
- **Section 3 — Supporting Files:** Drag-and-drop file upload, PDF/JPG/PNG up to 5MB

Additional features: privacy consent checkbox, honeypot spam prevention, async Formspree submission, success/error states.

**Formspree dependency:** File uploads require a form backend — GitHub Pages cannot receive data. Dependency chain:
> Holly confirms referral inbox email → Holly creates Formspree account → Holly sends 8-char form ID to Ryan → Ryan replaces `TBC-FORMSPREE-ID` in `referrals.html`

**Files changed:** `referrals.html`

#### 3. Social icons and footer
Inline SVG icons (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) added to footer. Instagram confirmed active; Facebook and LinkedIn `href="#"` pending Holly.

**Files changed:** All HTML pages

---

## Session 4 — 26 March 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Context
Planning and design session via Claude (claude.ai). Focus on L-shaped sticky nav — design, iteration, and implementation across all 16 pages. No Claude Code used — changes packaged in skeleton v7 for manual push.

### Work Completed

#### 1. L-shaped sticky nav — designed, iterated, and implemented

**Final spec:**

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Left column | 200px fixed width, full viewport height, Sage Soft background |
| Top bar | Full width minus left column, 60px height, Sage Soft background |
| Arc junction | 56px radius, radial-gradient — Sage Soft regardless of page content behind |
| Left column | Logo, brass divider, contact details (phone, email, address, hours), Book an Appointment (primary), Refer a Patient (secondary) |
| Top bar | Wordmark ("castleton / DENTAL PRACTICE"), brass divider, nav links |
| Nav link states | Rest: Ink on Sage Soft / Hover + active: White on Dark Olive pill |
| Mobile | Left column hidden, top bar full width, hamburger → drawer |

**Arc technique:** `radial-gradient(circle at 100% 100%, transparent [radius], Sage Soft [radius])` — stays Sage Soft regardless of page content scrolling behind.

**`styles.css` changes:** Old nav CSS block replaced with L-shaped nav system. `--left-width: 200px`, `--top-height: 60px`, `--arc-radius: 56px` in `:root`.

**Files changed:** All 16 HTML pages, `styles.css`

**Deliverable:** `castleton_skeleton_v7.zip`

## Session 4 (cont.) — 27 March 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Work Completed

| Task | Notes |
|---|---|
| Restored Google Maps embed | Both `contact.html` and `index.html` — Place ID `0x48742daba0c2eb6d:0x4a77be4480f6da66` had been overwritten by the arc nav commit |
| Mobile navigation — diagnosis and fix | See detail below |

### Mobile Navigation — Diagnosis & Fixes

**Root cause:** Every page contained two conflicting `<script>` blocks — an old `nav--open` script and the new arc nav script — both declaring `const hamburger`. Browsers throw a `SyntaxError` on duplicate `const` declarations, silently killing all nav JS.

**All fixes applied (23 files changed):**
1. Stale JS removed — old `nav--open` script blocks purged from all active HTML pages
2. Backdrop overlay — `.nav-overlay` div created dynamically; dims content behind open drawer; tapping overlay closes drawer
3. Hamburger → × animation — CSS transitions on three spans
4. Border selector bug fixed — `.nav-mobile-drawer a:last-child` → `> a:last-of-type`

---

## Session 5 — 28 March 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Context
Claude Code session. Focus on logo replacement, hero photography, and hero layout improvements.

### Work Completed

#### 1. Nav logo — replaced with house illustration across all pages
`castleton-logo.png` replaced with `castleton-house.png` across all 21 HTML pages (root + treatments).

**Files changed:** All HTML pages

#### 2. Logo made clickable
Both logo instances wrapped in `<a>` links. Root pages link to `index.html`; treatments subpages link to `../index.html`.

**Files changed:** All HTML pages

#### 3. `nav-left__wordmark` removed
"castleton / Dental Practice" `<p>` element below sidebar logo removed. Top bar wordmark retained.

**Files changed:** All HTML pages

#### 4. Building photography added to hero — `index.html`
Placeholder replaced with `castleton_outside.jpeg`. CSS updated: placeholder styling removed, `overflow: hidden` added.

**Files changed:** `index.html`, `styles.css`

#### 5. Hero typography — fluid scaling with `clamp()`

| Element | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `.hero__title` | `3.25rem` | `clamp(1.75rem, 2.5vw + 0.5rem, 3.25rem)` |
| `.hero__subtitle` | `1.125rem` | `clamp(1rem, 1vw + 0.5rem, 1.125rem)` |
| `.hero__body` | `1rem` | `clamp(0.9rem, 0.5vw + 0.75rem, 1rem)` |

**Files changed:** `styles.css`

#### 6. Hero image layout fixes
- Removed `min-height: 400px` causing border to exceed image height
- Changed `height: 100%` → `height: auto` on `.hero__image img`
- Added `margin-inline: auto` for centred alignment on single-column viewports
- Moved two-column grid from `.hero` to `.hero .container` so `hero__content` and `hero__image` become proper grid items

**Files changed:** `styles.css`

## Session 6 — 3 April 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Context
Planning session via Claude (claude.ai). Full design direction reset per Castleton management. New palette, retired nav architecture, CSS and HTML updated across all 16 pages. Changes packaged in skeleton v8 for manual push via GitHub Desktop.

### Work Completed

#### 1. `styles.css` — Full palette reset to v4.0

Complete palette replacement. Olive/linen family retired. Brass accent retired. New family: powder blue / sage blue / dusty teal.

| Variable | v3.0 | v4.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-primary` | `#8A8E75` Olive | `#AFC6C9` Muted Sage Blue |
| `--color-primary-dark` | `#BEC5A4` Sage Soft | `#7FA6A8` Dusty Teal |
| `--color-primary-mid` | `#68604D` Dark Olive | `#DDE8E6` Soft Powder Blue |
| `--color-primary-light` | `#D5C7AD` Sand | `#E6E7E5` Cool Grey Marble |
| `--color-bg` | `#F1EAD8` Linen | `#F7F6F3` Warm White |
| `--color-brass` | `#B5935A` | Retired — no replacement |

Footer background updated to `#6E5C4F` Natural Branch Brown. Hero background updated to `#DDE8E6` Powder Blue.

All `.brass-bar` → `.teal-bar`, `btn--brass` → `btn--teal` throughout. Zero brass references remaining.

Photography placeholder CSS added: `.photo-placeholder`, `.photo-placeholder--hero`, `--card`, `--portrait`, `--about` — styled divs with "Photography TBC" label, correct aspect ratios.

**Files changed:** `styles.css`

#### 2. Nav — L-shaped retired, standard horizontal nav reinstated

L-shaped nav, arc div, and left column removed from all 16 pages. Standard horizontal nav implemented:
- Logo left, nav links centre, Book Appointment CTA right
- Mobile: hamburger → full-width drawer (Muted Sage Blue background)
- Treatment subpages retain `../` prefix on all paths

Nav JS updated to match new element IDs (`nav-hamburger`, `nav-drawer`, `nav-drawer-close`). Drawer starts hidden via inline `style="display:none"`.

**Files changed:** All 16 HTML pages, `styles.css`

**Deliverable:** `castleton_skeleton_v8.zip`

## Session 7 — 3 April 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Context
Continuation of Session 6. Focused on setting up live preview tooling inside Claude Code, followed by UI refinements to the nav and CTA buttons.

### Work Completed

#### 1. Live Preview panel — two-server proxy architecture

**Problem:** Claude Code's `preview_start` tool spawns child processes inside a macOS sandbox that blocks access to `~/Documents/GitHub/Castleton`. All direct server approaches (Ruby WEBrick, Python `http.server`) failed with `EPERM` or `PermissionError: getcwd`.

**Solution:** Two-server proxy:
- **Port 3002** — real file server started via the Bash tool (inherits Claude Code's Full Disk Access). Serves the Castleton repo directly.
- **Port 3001** — lightweight Python proxy (`/tmp/castleton_proxy.py`) managed by `preview_start`. Forwards all HTTP requests to port 3002. Child process sandbox cannot read files but CAN make localhost network connections.
- Preview panel connects to port 3001 and renders the live site.

Same approach applied to `ryanbishop.github.io` on ports 3004 (file server) / 3003 (proxy).

**Config:** `.claude/launch.json` in the worktree — two entries: `Castleton Dental (static)` and `Ryan Bishop (static)`.

**Restore after restart:**
1. Run `python3 -m http.server --directory /Users/ryan/Documents/GitHub/Castleton 3002 &` via Bash tool
2. Call `preview_start "Castleton Dental (static)"`
3. Proxy scripts live at `/tmp/castleton_proxy.py` and `/tmp/ryanbishop_proxy.py` (recreate from memory file if `/tmp` was cleared)

**Files changed:** `.claude/launch.json` (worktree)

#### 2. `styles.css` — subtle drop shadow on all CTA buttons

Added `box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)` to the `.btn` base class. Affects all button variants (`btn--primary`, `btn--ghost`, etc.) across all pages automatically.

**Files changed:** `styles.css`

#### 3. `index.html` — "Refer a Patient" CTA added to desktop nav

Added a second CTA button (`btn--ghost`) immediately after the "Book an Appointment" button in the desktop nav bar. Uses `nav__cta` class (hidden at mobile, visible at 768px+). Links to `referrals.html`.

**Files changed:** `index.html`

#### 4. `index.html`, `contact.html` — Google Maps embed Place ID restored

Both files had reverted to a placeholder embed URL (`!1s0x0%3A0x0`) with no valid place. Restored the verified GBP Place ID embed URL on both pages:

Place ID: `0x48742daba0c2eb6d:0x4a77be4480f6da66`

**Files changed:** `index.html`, `contact.html`

## Session 8 — 3 April 2026

**Attendees:** Ryan Bishop (ryanbishop.co.uk)

### Context
Continuation of Session 7 (same day). UI refinements: font upgrade, marble texture, mobile layout fixes, and nav improvements.

### Work Completed

#### 1. `styles.css` — Cormorant Garamond display font

Added Google Fonts `@import` for Cormorant Garamond (all weights 300–700, roman + italic). Introduced `--font-heading` design token applied to all `h1–h6`. `--font-primary` retained for nav, buttons, and UI labels.

Font identified from client-supplied inspiration mockup (luxury dental aesthetic). Cormorant Garamond matched on: calligraphic stroke quality, diagonal stress axis, bracketed serifs, moderate x-height.

**Files changed:** `styles.css`

#### 2. `styles.css` — SVG marble texture (feTurbulence)

Inline SVG `feTurbulence` (`fractalNoise`) applied as `background-image` on three levels:
- `body` — covers gaps between sections
- `.section` base class — all sections automatically textured
- `.section--marble` — utility class for targeted use

Key parameters: `baseFrequency='0.03 0.018'`, `numOctaves='5'`, `stitchTiles='stitch'` (seamless tiling), `feColorMatrix` alpha `0.80` (strong effect across all section colours). No external image file required.

The `stitchTiles='stitch'` attribute fixed a visible vertical seam at 700px tile boundaries.

**Files changed:** `styles.css`, `index.html`

#### 3. `styles.css` — Hero layout fix

**Problem:** `.hero` had `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` at 768px+. After the hero restructure (building photo moved to `.hero-banner`, team photo removed pending client supply), only `.container` remained as a child — occupying one grid cell and leaving the right half of the section empty.

**Fix:** Changed `.hero` to `display: block` at 768px+. Removed `max-width: 640px` from `.hero__content` so text spans the full container width.

**Files changed:** `styles.css`

#### 4. `styles.css`, `index.html` — Nav + button improvements

- Added `Refer a Patient` ghost CTA button to desktop nav alongside Book an Appointment
- Fixed nav CTA specificity bug (`.nav .nav__cta` vs `.btn` both setting `display`)
- Added `box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` to all `.btn` variants
- Hero image: `height: auto` at mobile (full building visible); `65vh` + `object-fit: cover` at 768px+

**Files changed:** `styles.css`, `index.html`

## Appendix — Google Maps Custom Logo Pin: Step-by-Step Guide for Holly

The map on the Contact page currently shows Google's standard red pin. To replace it with the Castleton logo, a **Google Maps JavaScript API key** is needed. This is free for a site of this size — Google provides $200/month credit, and a dental practice website will use a tiny fraction of that.

### What Holly needs to do

**Step 1 — Create a Google Cloud project**
1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with the practice's Google account
2. Click **Select a project** → **New Project**
3. Name it `Castleton Dental Website` → **Create**

**Step 2 — Enable the Maps JavaScript API**
1. Go to **APIs & Services → Library**
2. Search `Maps JavaScript API` → **Enable**

**Step 3 — Set up billing**
Link a card — required by Google but the $200/month free credit means no charge for normal traffic.

**Step 4 — Create an API key**
Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → API Key**. Copy the key.

**Step 5 — Restrict the key**
Under Application restrictions: select Websites, add `https://www.castletondental.co.uk/*` and `https://castletondental.co.uk/*`. Under API restrictions: select Maps JavaScript API. Save.

**Step 6 — Pass the key to Ryan**
Send securely. Ryan will implement the branded logo pin on the Contact page.

> **Never commit the API key to GitHub.** Domain restriction in Step 5 ensures it can only be used on the Castleton website.

*Note: `styles.css` at v4.0 per Style Guide v4.0 — April 2026. Skeleton at v8.*
